Hi, I’m Jacob!
I’m a web developer with in-depth experience in both frontend and backend technologies.
In a nutshell, I create websites that help organizations address business challenges and meet their needs.
I manage everything from website navigation and layout to a company’s web hosting and security architecture.
My expertise lies within front-end web apps, and the main languages in my tech stack are JavaScript, React, and of course HTML/CSS.
I’m a lifelong learner (currently taking a course on building AI chatbots with Python!) and love to read, run, and find new bubble tea shops in Hamilton.
